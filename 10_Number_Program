# Function to calculate the sum of digits of a given number
def findSum(n):
    sum = 0  # Initialize sum to store the sum of digits
    
    # Loop to extract and sum each digit of the number
    while n != 0:
        dig = n % 10       # Get the last digit of n
        sum = sum + dig    # Add the extracted digit to sum
        n = n // 10        # Remove the last digit from n by integer division
    
    return sum  # Return the sum of the digits

# Test the function with an example
sum = findSum(65)
print(f"The sum of the digits is {sum}")

OUTPUT: The sum of the digits is is 11
